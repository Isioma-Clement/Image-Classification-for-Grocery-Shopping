# Image-Classification-for-Grocery-Shopping
This project attempts to classify various fruits and vegetables typically found in a grocery store using different machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithms Used:

- Random Forest Classifier

- MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)

- KMeans Clustering

 ## Preprocessing Techniques

- 3-way dataset split ( train, val, test)

- Dataset shuffling

- Image Cropping and Reshaping

- Image Normalization

- Image Conversion (RGB to Grayscale)

## Optimization Techniques Attempted

- Feature Extraction ( Sobel Edge Detection + Gaussian Blur)

- Hyperparameter Tuning ( using Gridsearch to find optimum parameters)

- Ensemble Learning using the Voting Classifier on 4 MLPs

- PCA
